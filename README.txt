Introduction
============

This recipe installs Celery and creates a ``celeryconfig.py`` module with
the specified configuration options. It helps managing multiple configurations
(e.g. development and production) using buildout.

You can use it in a part like this::

    [celery]
    recipe = collective.recipe.celery
    broker-transport = sqlakombu.transport.Transport
    broker-url = sqlite:///celery_broker.db
    result-backend = database
    result-dburi = sqlite:///celery_results.db
    imports = myapp.tasks
    eggs =
        kombu-sqlalchemy
        myapp

Supported options
=================

General options
---------------

eggs
    A list of additional eggs you want to make available to Celery. Use this to
    add additional dependencies such as ``kombu-sqlalchemy`` or the module(s)
    containing your task definitions.

scripts
    Controls which scripts are generated. If the option is omitted, then all
    scripts will be generated. If no value is given, then script generation is
    disabled.

config-path
    The location of the directory containing the ``celeryconfig.py`` module. By
    default the config module is created in the part directory.
    You can use this in other parts to include the config module::

        [celery]
        recipe = collective.recipe.celery

        [myapp]
        recipe = zc.recipe.egg
        eggs = myapp
        extra-paths = ${celery:config-path}

--------------

The following configuration options are supported. See Celery documentation for

            CELERY_TASK_PUBLISH_RETRY_POLICY={"max_retries": 2,
                                              "interval_start": 10,
